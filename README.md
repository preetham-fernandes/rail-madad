### ‼️🚅**Rail Madad : Al-powered Complaint Management Substitute for Indian Railways**‼️


### 🙋‍♂️Addressing the problem:

- **Streamlines the Complaint Process** - Automates complaint categorization and routing, reducing response times and improving efficiency.
- **Automated Complaint Resolution**  - Improves complaint handling by classifying into categories, extracting data with OCR & NLP, understanding complaint context through NLP.
- **Enables Proactive Maintenance** - Detects recurring issues and enables predictive maintenance, providing resolution and preventing major breakdowns. 
- **Encourages User Engagement** - Faster resolution, real-time updates, and multiple platform functionality with Progressive web app.

### 🥇Proposed solution:
The proposed solution aims to revolutionize the Railmadad platform by introducing a chatbot-based interface that leverages OCR and YOLO technologies for efficient complaint handling. Users will be guided through the process by the chatbot, which will extract necessary information from uploaded images and automatically categorize, prioritize, and route complaints. A dashboard for commanding officers will provide real-time insights into complaint trends, enabling proactive maintenance and reduce response time. Additionally, a feedback mechanism with user incentives will encourage active participation and continuous improvement. A multi-platform navigation system with 3D interactive maps implemented using AR, voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers, and digital kiosks will enhance accessibility and streamline the overall passenger experience.
